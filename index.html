            Project 3
        </h1>
        <p>
            This app builds on what we created in project 2. We are going to create a tic-tac-toe game that supports two game modes: pass-and-play and computer.
        </p>

        <div>
            Requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The start screen should have a label with the title of the game
                </li>
                <li>
                    The start screen should also have two buttons with the titles “Pass and Play” and “Play against Computer” that, when pressed, take you to a tic-tac-toe screen where you can play those game modes
                </li>
                <li>
                    When “Pass and Play” is clicked, the tic-tac-toe screen should work in the same way as described in the project 2 requirements
                </li>
                <li>
                    When “Play against Computer” is clicked, the tic-tac-toe screen should have the same appearance as in the “Pass and Play” mode
                </li>
                <li>
                    In “Play against Computer” mode, after the user plays a move, the computer should respond with a valid move
                </li>
                <li>
                    All of the content should be fully visible no matter the size of the screen
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Here is an example of how your app should work:
